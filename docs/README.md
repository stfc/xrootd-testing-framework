## XRootD Testing Framework
GitHub Repository: <https://github.com/stfc/xrootd-testing-framework/>

### What This Framework Is For:
This framework is made to test XRootD functionalities and performance on pre-deployed endpoints. The purpose of these tests is to:
* Check that basic XRootD functionality works with the endpointâ€™s setup and configuration
  
* Benchmark the performance of file transfer and deletion


### Overview of How It Works:
The testing framework uses [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/contents.html) to parametrize and run the tests. Accessory classes are used to setup the data for the tests. The classes are organised into 3 types: **_ReadWriteTests_**, **_ThirdPartyCopyTests_** and **_MetadataTests_**, with attributes and methods specific to their type. 

To set up a test, a test object is created from the relevant class. This object stores the endpoints that will be tested against, the port(s), and the protocol. The method **_genScenarios_** is used to setup _functional_ tests, by generating XRootD (or gfal2) commands for each combination of protocol and endpoint. 

The commands will then be run asynchronously using the [asyncio-subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html) module, which return a returncode, stdout and stderr to be stored as results. Other outputs relevant to the type of command are also stored, such as checksums. Once the commands have been run, the outputs will be returned by genScenarios in a dictionary, under keys describing the type of output. 

For _performance_ tests, **_genTimedScenarios_** is used to:
* Get the start and end time of the command
* Re-run the command (default: 3) times
* Get the average time taken to run the commands

This average time is returned with the returncode, stdout and stderr.  
After setting up the test by running the relevant commands, the output data is used to [parametrise](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/parametrize.html#basic-pytest-generate-tests-example) the Pytest test function. Each command is a scenario, and its output is used as a test case.
